## My final project for COMM318 _Stories from Data_ (Fall2020)

My final project for COMM 318 will investigate whether Tom Brady is the GOAT (Greatest Of All Time). As a devoted Patriots fan, I have loved watching the team excel during the duration of my life, and feel very foortunate to have lived through the true golden age of the New England Patriots. Now that Tom Brady has left the team, I was nostalgic for watching his performance every Sunday, and wanted to  use my COMM 318 project to analyze his performance over time, and understand what made him so  remarkable. 

### Is Tom Brady really the GOAT?

This was the question I chose to answer. Brady has been deemed this title in the public eye, and as a huge Tom Brady and Patriots fan, I wanted to see if the data was there to back it up. Though he plays for a different team now, his 19 year run on the Patriots made history, so I have chosen to analyze his performance then. 

The dataset where most of my analysis came from is from FiveThirtyEight, which was  a dataset that included every NFL game from 1920 to today. The data was in terms of Elo Rating, a rating algorithm I later explain, and provided insight into Brady's performance over the years. I also used data from Google Trends, to find when the public started viewing Tom Brady as the GOAT. For a more complete analysis, more types of data (e.g. different metrics and quantifiers) would have been helpful, and can be something I investigate in the future.

Ultimately, the data story shows that this decision can not necessarily be decided by just one perspective of his performance, but does exemplify how elite of a quarterback Brady has become. His nine Super Bowl appearances and six Super Bowl wins are just one aspect of his greatness, and his career is not over yet!
